Open Design Kit is a living collection of guides and best practices to help you to make and design openly.

The Kit was originally incubated at [Bocoup](https://bocoup.com/) and became a community-owned project in Summer 2017.

Please help us make it better by contributing to it with feedback on [Github](https://github.com/open-design-kit/opendesignkit) or on the #opendesignkit channel in the [Open Design Foundation Slack](http://slack.opendesign.foundation/) community.
