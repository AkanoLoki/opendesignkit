# Open Design Kit
A toolkit for open design practices

# Why do we need *another* compilation of tools?
* To provide a framework for design thinking and conversations within open source development
* To build a shared vocabulary for each method among [Bocoup](www.bocoup.com) staff and clients
* To supply engineers with tools to support their conceptual inquiries
* To explore what makes open source design practices unique 

# How to Use the Kit
There is no set order of operations for getting started with the kit.  The idea is that once you find yourself in a jam, you can reference the kit to identify tools and practices to support you in getting from problem identification to solution. 


# Accessible design, by and for everyone
While these practices have been road tested for open source projects, they can be used by anyone, anywhere on any project. If that isnâ€™t the case, go ahead a remix them! Design should be accessible and responsive to the unique needs of specific inquiries and problems.
