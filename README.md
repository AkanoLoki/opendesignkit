# Description
[Bocoup](https://bocoup.com/)'s Design team maintains Open Design Kit as an open source tool. It's design for collaborators who are not co-located. The Kit includes activities from ideation to implementation and is meant to evolve with use. To share your feedback or add a method, open an issue or pull request on our Github repository.

# How to Use the Kit
There is no set order of operations for getting started with the kit.  The idea is that once you find yourself in a jam, you can reference the kit to identify tools and practices to support you in getting from problem identification to solution.

The kit also helps to bridge the gap between the work of design and the work of implementing a design, there are ideas and thoughts about how to do that and hopefully help the process go smoothly. Design kits are not generic. What works for one community/company might not suit another. If the methods in here don't resonate with you that's totally ok, and better yet - submit ones that do! 


# Accessible design, by and for everyone
While these practices have been road tested for open source projects, they can be used by anyone, anywhere on any project. If that isnâ€™t the case, go ahead a remix them! Design should be accessible and responsive to the unique needs of specific inquiries, problems and abilities.


# Inspiration
This exploration was inspired by many individuals and organizations. A few projects that do a great job at identifying design tools and practices are [Ideo's HCD Design Kit](http://www.designkit.org/), [18F's Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/) and [Gov.uk Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles). The goal of this kit is not to replace these resources, but to live beside them.
