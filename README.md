# Status
Jess started tinkering with the project concept a bit. The week of May 16 - Bocoup will be having a design sprint to build out a minimum loveable product. The sprint team includes Jess Klein, Pam Drouin, Sue Lockwood and Susan Robertson. 

# How to get involved
to come

# Why do we need *another* compilation of tools?
* To provide a framework for design thinking and conversations within open source development
* To supply open source practitioners with tools to support their conceptual inquiries
* To **explore** what makes open source design practices unique 

# How to Use the Kit
There is no set order of operations for getting started with the kit.  The idea is that once you find yourself in a jam, you can reference the kit to identify tools and practices to support you in getting from problem identification to solution. 


# Accessible design, by and for everyone
While these practices have been road tested for open source projects, they can be used by anyone, anywhere on any project. If that isnâ€™t the case, go ahead a remix them! Design should be accessible and responsive to the unique needs of specific inquiries and problems. 


# Inspiration
This exploration was inspired by many individuals and organizations. A few projects that do a great job at identifying design tools and practices are [Ideo's HCD Design Kit](http://www.designkit.org/), [18F's Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/) and [Gov.uk Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/design-principles). The goal of this kit is not to replace these resources, but to live beside them.
