**We believe that:** fixing current ambiguity that bocoup has in terms of UX <br>
**will** make staffing, selling, and project management better for projects with design <br>
**We will know we are right when:** we have more success with less miserable postmortem comments.

**We believe that:** design implementation should continue the conversation between design and development.<br>
**will:** To that end, we’ll continue to have conversations throughout the process until the design is fully implemented. Designers will be available to chat through implementation hurdles and developers will be open to feedback and tweaking in the final implementation. If design feels comfortable, they’ll even jump into the code which will be OK with developers as well as developers jumping into prototyping and design pieces if they feel comfortable. <br>
**We will know we are right when:**
- Design and development both feel comfortable working through implementation and communicating about it.
- When frustration levels are low throughout the implementation and refinement process.
- When both design and development are excited and feel good about the finished product.
- When we have documentation on the design using the code to do so (pattern library, style guide, etc)

**We believe that:** being open about design <br>
**will:** further the understanding that Bocoupers have about design<br>
**We will know we are right when:** Bocoupers start implementing open design processes and principles in their work
