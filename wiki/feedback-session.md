**Method:** Feedback

---

**Description:** Getting effective and actionable feedback on your ideas can be challenging. This method explores some ways to structure your feedback session.

---

**Why use or do it:** Working as a lone wolf designer can be dangerous because you are relying on your own assumptions, background and expertise to make decisions. A feedback session shares the risk and responsibility.

---

**Whoâ€™s involved:** Try to get as many stakeholders and product team members in the room. Having a feedback session for just the "design team" can be effective for technique based decisions, but the goal is to gather a set of diverse voices to inform your work. Engineers can be effective feedback participants because it gives them a chance to think about the problem space well before implementation begins.

**When to use it:** This is a tricky thing to decide. In general, when working on a project, you should routinely be running feedback sessions.
