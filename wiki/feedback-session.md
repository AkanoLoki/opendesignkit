**Method:** Feedback Session

---

**Description:** Getting effective and actionable feedback on your ideas can be challenging. This method explores some ways to structure your feedback session.

---

**Why use or do it:** Working as a lone wolf designer can be dangerous because you are relying on your own assumptions, background and expertise to make decisions. A feedback session shares the risk and responsibility.

---

**Whoâ€™s involved:** Try to get as many stakeholders and product team members in the room. Having a feedback session for just the "design team" can be effective for technique based decisions, but the goal is to gather a set of diverse voices to inform your work. Engineers can be effective feedback participants because it gives them a chance to think about the problem space well before implementation begins.

**When to use it:** It's tricky thing to decide when to run a feedback session. In general, when working on a project, you should routinely be running feedback sessions.

**How To Run a Feedback Session:**

* **Step 1:** Schedule and announce your feedback session in advance. A feedback or critique meeting can be mentally taxing - for all participants, so plan for it to take no longer than 90 minutes if anyone is not co-located. 

* **Step 2:** Share work in advance of the scheduled meeting. Break down the schedule based on the total time that you have set aside for the session. Each presenter should prepare materials to share prior to the session. Limit the amount of presentations so that each presenter has enough time to both present and receive feedback.

* **Step 3:** Inform all attendees how they can participate.
* **Step 4:** Presentations
* **Step 5:** Guide and document the feedback
* **Step 6:** Define next steps
