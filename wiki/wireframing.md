**Method:** Wireframing

---

**Description:** Wireframes allow you to refine and turn your sketches and user flows into a tangible representation of your project or product. 


---

**Why use or do it:**
Wireframes are a low fidelity way to think through the patterns and flows required for users to accomplish tasks that have been defined using methods such as writing the design brief, creating a journey map or defining personas. If you were building a house, wireframes would be the blueprints to help you to develop out your plan for implementation.

---

**Whoâ€™s involved:**
While designers should create the wireframes, stakeholders and engineers should be actively involved in providing [feedback](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/blob/master/wiki/feedback-session.md).

---

**When to use it:**
Once you have a general answer to the following two questions, you should be prepared to wireframe:
1. What's the problem that you are trying to solve?
2. Who is it a problem for?

That said, many designers begin work on wireframes after the development of [personas](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/blob/master/wiki/Personas.md) and [journey maps](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/blob/master/wiki/Journey-Maps.md).
