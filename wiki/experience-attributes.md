**Method:** Experience Attributes

---

**Description:** Collaboratively generate descriptive words to inform the mood boards and visual direction of the project. 


---

**Why use or do it:**  Prior to working on the visual design for a product, project or website, you often need the entire product team and stakeholders to agree upon a common terminology for the look and feel of things. This exercise provides a space for everyone to explore what a successful and effective design might be. This is also a great opportunity to decide what just feels right for this specific design opportunity.

---

**Who’s involved:** Designers and stakeholders. These should be done collaboratively. The bonus of collaborating and working openly is that there is a shared understanding and valuable conversations that arrive through the process.


---

**When to use it:** This method can be done as part of the Visual Design Workshop. The workshop is most effective when done as a kickoff to the visual design phase(s) of a project. This can happen well before the ux direction of the project is defined and/or the design of wireframes is finalized. Because remote or not co-located meetings can be extremely draining, consider breaking this workshop into a few sessions - with each session no longer than 90 minutes. The actual scheduling will depend on the client, the availability, the timeline, etc.

**How To Generate Experience Attributes**

* Step 1: Place tons of different images on the wall in a matrix 
* Step 2: Give participants 10 red dots and 10 green dots
LOOK at personas, project brief
* Step 3: Then give them 20 minutes to stand up, study the pictures, and put dots directly on the images. Green dots are for images that have some kind of positive association (in your mind) with the Product mission, red for negative. (Remind participants that there’s no right answer here. It’s the conversation that arises that’s important).
* Step 4: When all of the dots have been added, facilitate a conversation amongst the group about why they voted the way they did. Start with the ones that had a lot of reds, since people often find it very easy to talk about what’s undesirable. Move to the ones that had a lot of greens to solicit positive attributes.
* Step 5: Capture the adjectives that they are using during this conversation on a spectrum using sticky notes
