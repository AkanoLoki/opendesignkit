**How To Generate Experience Attributes**

* Step 1: Place tons of different images on the wall in a matrix 
* Step 2: Give participants 10 red dots and 10 green dots
LOOK at personas, project brief
* Step 3: Then give them 20 minutes to stand up, study the pictures, and put dots directly on the images. Green dots are for images that have some kind of positive association (in your mind) with the Product mission, red for negative. (Remind participants that there’s no right answer here. It’s the conversation that arises that’s important).
* Step 4: When all of the dots have been added, facilitate a conversation amongst the group about why they voted the way they did. Start with the ones that had a lot of reds, since people often find it very easy to talk about what’s undesirable. Move to the ones that had a lot of greens to solicit positive attributes.
* Step 5: Capture the adjectives that they are using during this conversation on a spectrum using sticky notes
