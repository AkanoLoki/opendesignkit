There are _many_ ways to name these things (pattern libraries and design systems are also common), and Bocoup’s preference is Style Guides as we feel it’s more inclusive and broad. So in that vein, our definition is:

> A style guide is a living document of code, which details all the various elements and coded modules of your site or application. Beyond its use in consolidating the front-end code, it also documents the visual language, and if the team so desires, can have sections for branding, voice and tone, and more. It’s your way to document the various pieces that make up how you work on our site or application.

Also: this should be one of the first steps in implementing a design, rather than be done after the fact. That way you document what you will use and building out pages, templates, etc will be easier.

We should state up front that we favor creating a process that is custom to the team that is working on the project. This means that while there are a lot of ways to create systems, no two teams are probably going to do it exactly the same. Right now there is a lot of desire to copy the systems that are getting talked about a lot (Salesforce Lightning is one such) but that probably won’t work for most teams. But see below for ideas on how to do that, both in looking at other teams’ guides as well as articles about how you can move forward.

For examples of style guides that have been created by various teams see:

If I had to say one thing for how to get from design to implementation as a *team* it would be the [Charlotte Jackson article](http://alistapart.com/article/from-pages-to-patterns-an-exercise-for-everyone) on ALA. This could be harder to do remotely, but I still believe it’s possible.

To get from design ideas into implementation that makes sense for the *entire* team (I include product or project managers and engineers when I say this) you need to work together to identify, name, and design your style guide ([see the interface inventory resource](tk)). It’s fine for a designer to design a few pages and then go from there to figure out an overarching system that will work for the entire site or application.

So this stage would come after the designers have had some time to work on visual design based on all the preceding steps. BUT developers should be involved through much of the design process, to understand what is coming and make sure what is being proposed can be built.
