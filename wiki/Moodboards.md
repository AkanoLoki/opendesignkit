**Method:** Moodboards

---

**Description:** A collection of images based on adjectives associated with the brand's project that serve as inspiration for visual studies.

---

**Why use or do it:** Conducting a visual research using the resulted words from the [Experience Attribute](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/Experience-Attributes) activity, helps set the stage for exploring visual studies in a later phase. Moodboards also help us start a conversation with the stakeholders about how the project could look like and make sure their expectations are met in an early stage.

---

**Whoâ€™s involved:** Designers and stakeholders. This could be done in collaboration with the stakeholders as part of the [Visual Design Workshop](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/Visual-Design-Workshop) or as an activity that the designer(s) work on separately an present to the stakeholders before moving on to the visual studies.

---

**When to use it:** Right after the [Experience Attributes](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/experience-attributes) activity and before starting doing any type of visual studies (aka style tiles and mockups).

**How To: Moodboards**

* **Step 1:**  
Using the words gathered from the [Experience Attributes](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/experience-attributes) and [Clustering activities](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/sticky-clustering), start searching for images.
* **Step 2:**  
Place the images in a document and organize them in a way that makes sense for you. As an alternative to using an image editing software, you can use an [inVision board](http://blog.invisionapp.com/boards-share-design-inspiration-assets/)
* **Step 3:**  
You can also include the words you used in order to reference the images with them.
* **Step 4:**  
Save and/or share your collection with the stakeholders and pay attention to their reaction, that way you'll get a sense if you've taken the right path or you need to continue exploring other ideas before moving on to the visual studies.
