**Method:**  Personas

--

**Description:** _Personas_ are user types based on habits and goals of real people, acquired through interviews and conversations.

--

**Why use or do it:** People relate to stories and other people. Personas give us a real human to connect with, someone who has goals for using the product.

--

**Who’s involved:** Designers and stakeholders. These should be done collaboratively. The bonus of collaborating and working openly is that there is a shared understanding and valuable conversations that arrive through the process of co-authoring the personas.

--

**When to use it:**  These are archetypes based on interviews. Ideally they are used after interviews and before journey mapping. That said, they are useful tools to refer to at any given point in your creation process.

1. **Overview:** A persona is a character who is respresentative of the needs, thoughts and goals of the target user.  Think of a persona as your typical or ideal user - who do you see using your app? It helps prevent you from generalizing all users into one bucket - thinking that everyone has the same needs and goals. It also prevents you from falling into the pattern of thinking that you are going to experience the application the same way that other users will.  Each person comes from a different background. Personas are designed to help you to empathize with individuals who might use the app, so think of them more as a bio that you might see on a dating website than a job description. 

2. **Goal:** Using your interview notes, create 1 - 2 personas to represent your core users. Each should have a slightly different story and use case. 

3. **Vital Stats:** Start by writing down a description for each persona. While [this template](https://github.com/bocoup/workshop-training-design/blob/master/handouts/persona-worksheet.png) or [this markdown one](https://github.com/bocoup/workshop-training-design/blob/master/handouts/persona-template.md) might be a useful tool to help you, a persona should generally include:
  - Name
  - Age, gender
  - Marital status
  - Occupation
  - Hobbies
  - Technology familiarity 
  - Devices used  

4. **Scenario:** Craft a scenario in which that person would like to use your app,tool,service,product {insert your deliverable}. What would that user's motivations, goals and needs be? What are their pain points and challenges?

5. **Add some personality**: Finesse the persona by including an image, name and quote that expresses the needs and goals of the user. *Tip:* Try using Creative Commons licensed images that you can find through Flickr. We highly recommend [these images](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wocintechchat/)

6. **Ask for feedback** Get feedback on your persona. A great way to frame feedback requests is to ask people what they ‘like’ about the persona, and what they ‘wish’ could be done differently or included. One way to test if your persona is actually working might be to have someone try to describe the app or experience for your persona. What would they come up with? 
You might put your persona to use by making a Journey Map and realize that it's  not quite right. It's totally understandable - and to some degree expected - that you will have to iterate  on your personas quite a bit. Your iteration, feedback and testing will help you to validate any assumptions that you made with your personas. Remember to tweet @bocoup #opendesignkit
