## Welcome to the Open Design Kit

Bocoup believes that great design comes from community engagement, skillshare and research. We are collaborating on and building this kit to share design ideas, tools, and techniques with the greater community. These tools can be used for your open source projects, but they are also useful in all kinds of projects.

In addition to helping with design, we are also keenly interested in how the implementation of design happens, so there is information on that as well. 

Please explore and use what you find helpful when you need it. Do you have ideas for things you think should be added? [Let us know!](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
