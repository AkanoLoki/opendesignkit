        <h3>Open Design Kit</h3>

        <p>We aim to collaborate to provide a set of tools and practices for getting better design results in open source and beyond. The kit is compromised of tools and ideas for thinking through design with your open source project colleagues or in any situation you may find yourself where design would be helpful.</p>

        <h3>Principles</h3>

        <p>to come</p>

        <h3>Key Documents</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/Open-Design-Kit:-Design-Brief">Design Brief</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/wiki/Hypotheses">Hypothesis</a><li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Status</h3>

        <p>Jess started tinkering with the project concept a bit. The week of May 16 - Bocoup will be having a design sprint to build out a minimum loveable product. The sprint team includes <a href="https://github.com/iamjessklein">Jess Klein</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pamela-drouin">Pam Drouin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/deathbearbrown">Sue Lockwood</a> and <a href="https://github.com/susanjrobertson">Susan Robertson</a>.</p>

    <h3>How to get involved</h3>
    <p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing doc</a> for more information.</p>

    <h3>Why do we need *another* compilation of tools?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide a framework for design thinking and conversations within open source development</li>
        <li>To supply open source practitioners with tools to support their conceptual inquiries</li>
        <li>To <strong>explore</strong> what makes open source design practices unique</li>
        <li>To explore practical ways to get from design to development in a flow that works for both sides</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Use the Kit</h3>
    <h4>Bocoupers</h4>
    <p>There is no set order of operations for getting started with the kit.  The idea is that once you find yourself in a jam, you can reference the kit to identify tools and practices to support you in getting from problem identification to solution.</p>
    <p>The kit also helps to bridge the gap between the work of design and the work of implementing a design, there are ideas and thoughts about how to do that and hopefully help the process go smoothly.</p>
    <h4>Everyone else</h4>
    <p>This was built using the design principals documented with in it. Our target user were other bocoupers and so the documentation was written with specific personas in mind. It's our belief that Design kits are not generic. What works for one community/company might not suit another.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to fork this repo and use it to build a design kit that suits your needs. Interview your team members and create your own personas, so you know what needs your team has. Then modify, add and remove based on their needs and goals.</p>
    <h3>Accessible design, by and for everyone</h3>
    <p>While these practices have been road tested for open source projects, they can be used by anyone, anywhere on any project. If that isnâ€™t the case, go ahead a remix them! Design should be accessible and responsive to the unique needs of specific inquiries and problems.</p>
    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>This exploration was inspired by many individuals and organizations. A few projects that do a great job at identifying design tools and practices are <a href="http://www.designkit.org/">Ideo's HCD Design Kit</a>, <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/">18F's Methods</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">Gov.uk Design Principles</a>. The goal of this kit is not to replace these resources, but to live beside them.</p>
