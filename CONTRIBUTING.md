# Contributing & Collaboration Guidelines
We have a ton of issues on [Github](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/issues) specifically labeled for contributors. Right now we could use support localizing the methods, testing out the methods, and reporting outright bugs.

## More information
We've outlined various ways to contribute on our [site](http://opendesignkit.org/contribute), so please refer to that. But either creating issues or creating a pull request are great ways to help us out. We can use both of those for discussion to move forward.
