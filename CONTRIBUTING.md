# Contributing & Collaboration Guidelines
If you'd like to contribute to this design kit you can join the discussion by commenting on or creating a new issue.

### Issues
Issues are used for discussion and exploration of topics. Communicating through IRC, email and Slack removes the history, process and context of decisions, so dicussion through issues is greatly encouraged.

### Wiki updates
To update the wiki, or add new pages, please do not edit directly.  Create a new markdown file in the wiki folder and submit a PR.
Once approved the repo admin can push changes to the wiki using the docs.sh bash script.

This is a temporary solution for a bigger problem, which is that github doesn't let you make PRs against the wiki
