# Contributing & Collaboration Guidelines
We have a ton of issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/bocoup/opendesignkit/issues) specifically labeled for contributors. Look for the "help wanted" and/or "first-timer-friendly" labels to get started. Right now we could use support localizing the methods, testing out the methods, and reporting outright bugs.
