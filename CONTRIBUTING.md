# Contributing & Collaboration Guidelines
If you'd like to contribute to this design kit you can join the discussion by commenting on or creating a new issue. 

### Issues
Issues are used for discussion and exploration of topics. Communicating through IRC, email and Slack removes the history, process and context of decisions, so dicussion through issues is greatly encouraged.  

### Wiki updates
To update the wiki, or add new pages, please do not edit directly.  Create an issue, if it does not already exist and post a link to a google doc that has writable access to anyone with the link.  That way people can make comments, fix spelling and grammar mistakes on a line by line basis. 
Once the doc is +1'd by the team, it can be added to the wiki.

This is a temporary solution for a bigger problem, which is that github doesn't let you make PRs against the wiki
